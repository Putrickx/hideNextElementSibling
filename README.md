This script hides the next element sibling of an element on HTML web pages, 
it also rotates an ASCII triangle/arrow down and sideways to indicate that the content is shown or hidden.

The .css and .js file work together to display a dropdown effect on the next element sibling upon clicking.

When clicked again, the next element sibling fades out and is hidden with a style transition.

The styling in the HTML file is just for div/text alignment and has no connection to the script.
